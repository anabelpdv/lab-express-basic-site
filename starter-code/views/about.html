        Fall, season of the year between summer and winter during which
        temperatures gradually decrease. It is usually defined in the Northern Hemisphere
        as the period between the autumnal equinox and the winter solstice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The autumn temperature transition between summer heat and winter cold
        occurs only in middle and high latitudes; in equatorial regions, temperatures generally 
        vary little during the year. In the polar regions autumn is very short.
      </p>
      <p>
        The concept of autumn in European languages is connected with the harvesting 
        of crops; in many cultures autumn, like the other seasons, has been marked by 
        rites and festivals revolving around the seasonâ€™s importance in food production. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Animals gather food in autumn in preparation for the coming winter, and those with 
        fur often grow thicker coats. Many birds migrate toward the Equator to escape the falling
        temperatures.
